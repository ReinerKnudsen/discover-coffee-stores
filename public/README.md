# Public Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains static files that are served directly by Next.js. Assets in this directory are accessible from the root URL of your application.

## Contents
- Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
- Public documents
- Static files that need to be accessible by URL

## Conventions
- Files in this directory are served as-is
- Files can be referenced from the application using the `/` path
- Consider using the `app` directory for route-specific assets instead

- See `/app` directory for application components and routes
- See root `README.md` for overall project documentation
